What is Coupling in Java? 
• Usage of an object by another object.
• It simply means that one object requires another object to complete its assigned task.
• There are two types of coupling:
    1. Tight Coupling
    2. Loose Coupling
 

Tight Coupling
• A group of classes are highly dependent on one another
• A class has a direct reference to a concrete class


Loose Coupling
• An object gets the object to be used from external sources
• Reduces the dependencies of a class that uses the different classes directly
