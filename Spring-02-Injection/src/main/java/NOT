Why You Should Use Constructor Injection in Spring?

What is Dependency Injection?
Dependency: An object usually requires objects of other classes to perform its operations. We call these objects dependencies.
Injection: The process of providing the required dependencies to an object.

Dependency injection is an approach to implement loose coupling among the classes in an application.
There are different ways of injecting dependencies.
 - constructor-based injection,
 - setter-based injection, or
 - field-based injection.

But constructor injection is the preferred way.

Dependency injection helps in implementing inversion of control (IoC).
This means that the responsibility of object creation and injecting the dependencies
is given to the framework (i.e. Spring) instead of the class creating the dependency
objects by itself.
